# Entity & Database Policies

The `policy` section, defined per `action`, defines item-level security rules (database policies) which limit the results returned from a request. The sub-section `database` denotes the database policy expression that is evaluated during request execution.

## Syntax overview

```json
{
  ...
  "entities": {
    "<entity-name>": {
      ...
      "policy": {
        "database": "<Expression>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Syntax**

The `database` policy: an OData-like expression that is translated into a query predicate that will be evaluated by the database. This include opreators like `eq`, `lt`, and `gt`. In order for results to be returned for a request, the request's query predicate resolved from a database policy must evaluate to `true` when executing against the database.

|Example Item Policy|Predicate
|-|-
|`@item.OwnerId eq 2000`|`WHERE Table.OwnerId = 2000`
|`@item.OwnerId gt 2000`|`WHERE Table.OwnerId > 2000`
|`@item.OwnerId lt 2000`|`WHERE Table.OwnerId < 2000`

> A `predicate` is an expression that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. Predicates are used in the search condition of [WHERE](/sql/t-sql/queries/where-transact-sql) clauses and [HAVING](/sql/t-sql/queries/select-having-transact-sql) clauses, the join conditions of [FROM](/sql/t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql) clauses, and other constructs where a Boolean value is required.

**Database policy**

Two types of directives can be used when authoring a database policy expression:

|Directive|Description
|-|-
|`@claims`| access a claim within the validated access token provided in the request.
|`@item`| represents a field of the entity for which the database policy is defined.

> [!NOTE]
> When **Azure Static Web Apps** authentication (EasyAuth) is configured, a limited number of claims types are available for use in database policies: `identityProvider`, `userId`, `userDetails`, and `userRoles`. See Azure Static Web App's [Client principal data](/azure/static-web-apps/user-information?tabs=javascript#client-principal-data) documentation for more details.

|Example Database Policy
|-
|`@claims.UserId eq @item.OwnerId`
|`@claims.UserId gt @item.OwnerId`
|`@claims.UserId lt @item.OwnerId`

Data API builder compares the value of the `UserId` claim to the value of the database field `OwnerId`. The result payload only includes records that fulfill **both** the request metadata and the database policy expression.

### Limitations

Database policies are supported for tables and views. Stored procedures can't be configured with policies.

Database policies can't be used to prevent a request from executing within a database. This is because database policies are resolved as query predicates in the generated database queries and are ultimately evaluated by the database engine.

Database policies are only supported for the `actions` **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete**.

### Supported OData-like operators

#### Binary Operators

| Operator | Description                      |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| `and`    | Logical AND                      |
| `or`     | Logical OR                       |
| `eq`     | Equals                           |
| `gt`     | Greater than                     |
| `lt`     | Less than                        |
| ...      | Additional binary operators      |

#### Unary Operators

| Operator | Description           |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `-`      | Negate                |
| `not`    | Logical negation (NOT)|
| ...      | Additional unary operators |

### Entity Field Names Restrictions

- **Rules**: Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`), followed by up to 127 letters, underscores (`_`), or digits (`0-9`).
  
- **Impact**: Fields not adhering to these rules cannot be directly used in database policies.

- **Solution**: Utilize the `mappings` section to create aliases for fields that do not meet these naming conventions, thereby ensuring all fields can be included in policy expressions.

### Utilizing `mappings` for Non-conforming Fields

If your entity field names don't meet the OData syntax rules, you can define conforming aliases in the `mappings` section of your configuration. Hereâ€™s an example approach to workaround field naming restrictions:

```json
"mappings": {
  "validFieldName": "NonConforming-Field_Name1",
  "anotherValidField": "Invalid Field Name 2"
}
```

In this example, `NonConforming-Field_Name1` and `Invalid Field Name 2` are original database field names that do not meet the OData naming conventions. By mapping these to `validFieldName` and `anotherValidField`, respectively, you ensure these fields can be referenced in database policy expressions without issue.

This approach not only helps in adhering to the OData naming conventions but also enhances the clarity and accessibility of your data model within both GraphQL and RESTful endpoints.

## Example

Consider an entity named `Employee` within a Data API configuration that utilizes both claims and item directives in its database policy to ensure data access is securely managed based on user roles and entity ownership:

```json
{
  "entities": {
    "Employee": {
      "rest": {
        "enabled": true,
        "path": "/employees",
        "methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT"]
      },
      "graphql": {
        "enabled": true,
        "type": {
          "singular": "Employee",
          "plural": "Employees"
        },
        "operation": "query"
      },
      "source": {
        "object": "EmployeesTable",
        "type": "table",
        "key-fields": ["EmployeeId"],
        "parameters": {}
      },
      "mappings": {
        "employeeId": "EmployeeId",
        "employeeName": "Name",
        "department": "DepartmentId"
      },
      "policy": {
        "database": "@claims.role eq 'HR' or @claims.UserId eq @item.EmployeeId"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Walkthrough

**Entity Definition**: The `Employee` entity is configured for REST and GraphQL interfaces, indicating its data can be queried or manipulated through these endpoints.

**Source Configuration**: Identifies the `EmployeesTable` in the database, with `EmployeeId` as the key field.

**Mappings**: Aliases are used to map `EmployeeId`, `Name`, and `DepartmentId` from the database to `employeeId`, `employeeName`, and `department` in the API, simplifying the field names and potentially obfuscating sensitive database schema details.

**Policy Application**: The `policy` section applies a database policy using an OData-like expression. This policy restricts data access to users with the HR role (`@claims.role eq 'HR'`) or to users whose `UserId` claim matches the `EmployeeId` field in the database (`@claims.UserId eq @item.EmployeeId`). This ensures that employees can only access their own records unless they belong to the HR department, illustrating how database policies can enforce row-level security based on dynamic conditions.
